Welcome to Jamal's Conversion App 1.0. Here's how to use the app:<div class="0">
<br></br>
First you will need something to convert. Simply enter the number of units you want to convert
then use the dropdown menu to choose what type of units you are using to the type of units desired
then everything will be converted automatically. That's it! Also remember these rules:
<br></br>
<br></br>
1) <i>Volume</i> is how much something holds.
<br></br>
2) <i>Length</i> is how long or short something is.
<br></br>
3) <i>Mass</i> is how much something weighs.
<br></br>
